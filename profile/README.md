Modporting is the organization used for storing the Fabric 1.21.1 ports created by Nexusrealms and maybe someday others.

minecraft_version=1.21.1

yarn_mappings=1.21.1+build.3

loader_version=0.16.10

fabric_version=0.114.0+1.21.1

The only project we have now is Surival Island, all the other repositiories are from the older iteration of modporting which ported to 1.21.4
